            <h2>Smart Car Features</h2>
            <p>
                Modern cars are equipped with intelligent systems that remember your preferences, optimize performance, and adapt to your driving style. These built-in features make driving safer, more comfortable, and more efficient.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, vehicles can store seat positions, mirror angles, and climate settings for different drivers. Navigation systems remember your recent destinations, and infotainment units keep your favorite playlists or radio stations.
            </p>
            <p>
                Performance optimization features include adaptive cruise control, real-time engine tuning, and energy-saving systems in hybrid and electric vehicles. Some advanced cars even use AI to adjust suspension or braking based on road conditions.
            </p>
            <p>
                These smart features are what make today's cars feel more personal, connected, and responsive â€” creating a seamless driving experience.
